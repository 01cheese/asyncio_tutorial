## **Chapter 13: Integrating Asynchronous Code with Other Technologies and Frameworks**

### **13.1. Introduction to Asynchronous Code Integration**

Integrating asynchronous code with various technologies and frameworks is a crucial aspect of developing modern applications. Asynchronous programming enables the creation of high-performance and scalable systems, but to fully harness its potential, seamless integration with other components of the architecture is essential. In this chapter, we will explore methods and tools for integrating asynchronous Python code with various technologies and frameworks, including web frameworks, databases, messaging systems, and more.

### **13.2. Integration with Web Frameworks**

Asynchronous web frameworks allow the creation of fast and scalable web applications capable of handling a large number of concurrent requests. Let's examine how to integrate asynchronous code with popular web frameworks.

#### **13.2.1. FastAPI and Asynchronous Routes**

FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with support for asynchronous programming. It allows easy integration of asynchronous functions into application routes.

**Example of an Asynchronous Route in FastAPI:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/async-endpoint")
async def async_endpoint():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an asynchronous operation
    return {"message": "Asynchronous Response"}
```

**Running the Application:**

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Description:**

- An asynchronous route `/async-endpoint` is defined, which performs an asynchronous delay before returning a response.
- Using asynchronous functions allows the server to handle other requests while waiting for operations to complete.

#### **13.2.2. Django and Asynchronous Views with Django 3.1+**

Starting from version 3.1, Django supports asynchronous views, enabling the use of `async` and `await` in request handlers.

**Example of an Asynchronous View in Django:**

```python
# views.py
from django.http import JsonResponse
import asyncio

async def async_view(request):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an asynchronous operation
    return JsonResponse({"message": "Asynchronous Response"})
```

**Setting Up URLs:**

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('async-view/', views.async_view, name='async_view'),
]
```

**Description:**

- An asynchronous view `async_view` is created, which performs an asynchronous delay before returning a JSON response.
- Asynchronous views allow for more efficient request handling, especially when interacting with external services.

### **13.3. Integration with Databases**

Asynchronous applications often interact with databases to store and retrieve data. To work efficiently, it's important to use asynchronous drivers and ORM libraries.

#### **13.3.1. Asynchronous Drivers for PostgreSQL: `asyncpg`**

`asyncpg` is a high-performance asynchronous driver for PostgreSQL, specifically designed to work with `asyncio`.

**Example of Using `asyncpg`:**

```python
import asyncio
import asyncpg

async def fetch_users():
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(user='user', password='password',
                                 database='testdb', host='127.0.0.1')
    rows = await conn.fetch('SELECT id, name FROM users')
    await conn.close()
    return rows

async def main():
    users = await fetch_users()
    for user in users:
        print(f"User {user['id']}: {user['name']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Description:**

- Establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database.
- Executes an asynchronous query to retrieve data from the `users` table.
- Closes the connection after the query is completed.

#### **13.3.2. Asynchronous ORM Libraries: `SQLAlchemy` and `Tortoise ORM`**

Asynchronous ORM libraries allow working with databases at a high level of abstraction using asynchronous coroutines.

**Example of Using `SQLAlchemy` in Asynchronous Mode:**

```python
import asyncio
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy import select
from models import User  # Assumes the User model is defined

DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/testdb"

engine = create_async_engine(DATABASE_URL, echo=True)
AsyncSessionLocal = sessionmaker(
    bind=engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False
)

async def get_users():
    async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:
        result = await session.execute(select(User))
        users = result.scalars().all()
        return users

async def main():
    users = await get_users()
    for user in users:
        print(f"User {user.id}: {user.name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Example of Using `Tortoise ORM`:**

```python
import asyncio
from tortoise import Tortoise, fields, models

class User(models.Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    name = fields.CharField(max_length=50)

async def init():
    await Tortoise.init(
        db_url='postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/testdb',
        modules={'models': ['__main__']}
    )
    await Tortoise.generate_schemas()

async def create_user(name):
    user = await User.create(name=name)
    return user

async def main():
    await init()
    user = await create_user("Alice")
    print(f"Created user: {user.id} - {user.name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Description:**

- **SQLAlchemy:** Provides powerful capabilities for working with databases, including migrations and complex queries.
